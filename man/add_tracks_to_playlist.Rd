\title{Add Tracks to User’s Playlist}
\usage{
add_tracks_to_playlist(
  playlist_id,
  uris,
  position = NULL,
  authorization = get_spotify_authorization_code()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{playlist_id}{Required. The
\href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/#spotify-uris-and-ids}{Spotify ID}
for the playlist.}

\item{uris}{Optional. A character vector of
\href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/#spotify-uris-and-ids}{Spotify track URIs} to add.
For example: \cr
uris = c("61H97kuKIpi6kJQRnUEIlh", "2q6vlgBJ432KeZZNt2ZZBV")\cr
A maximum of 100 tracks can be added in one request.
The uris will be formed as
uris = c("spotify%3Atrack%3A61H97kuKIpi6kJQRnUEIlh", "spotify%3Atrack%3A2q6vlgBJ432KeZZNt2ZZBV").
If you have the \code{"spotify:track:"} prefix in your vector it will
not be duplicated, otherwise it will be added.}

\item{position}{Optional. Integer indicating the position to insert the tracks,
a zero-based index. For example, to insert the tracks in the first position:
\code{position = 0}; to insert the tracks in the third position:
 \code{position = 2}. If omitted, the tracks will be appended to the playlist.
 Tracks are added in the order they are listed in the query string or request body.}

\item{authorization}{Required. A valid access token from the Spotify Accounts service.
See the \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/}{Web API authorization Guide} for more details. Defaults to \code{spotifyr::get_spotify_authorization_code()}.
The access token must have been issued on behalf of the current user. \cr
Adding tracks to the current user’s public playlists requires authorization of the
\code{playlist-modify-public} scope; adding tracks to the current user’s private
playlist (including collaborative playlists) requires the \code{playlist-modify-private} scope. See \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes}{Using Scopes}.}
