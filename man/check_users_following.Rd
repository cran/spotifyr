Following a playlist can be done publicly or privately. Checking if a user publicly follows a playlist doesnâ€™t require any scopes; if the user is publicly following the playlist, this endpoint returns \code{TRUE}. \cr
Checking if the user is privately following a playlist is only possible for the current user when that user has granted access to the \code{playlist-read-private} scope. See \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes}{Using Scopes}.}
